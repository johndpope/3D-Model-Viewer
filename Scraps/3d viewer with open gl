3d viewer with open gl 
should take in object files  (.obj) and display in 3d 
provide basic navigation : rotation, zoom, movement 
eventually want interaction (down the line) 
paraview – good example 


once I get to shading, might require lab computers
rendering should be fine on mac 
programming in c++ and open gl 

certain parts (back end) are open source, can look but should write your own 

---- 
need a better understanding of the computer graphics pipeline 
obj file: points and vectors. Must read them in and display 
some transformations take place, make sure you understand
transformations most basic first concept

---- 

IDE: official studio 2010 
Start using Eclipse ?

---- 

GUI: 
Glut
QT  (more modern) 
Can start from command line 

---- 
.obj files can be found online 
3D obj archive has models of everything online 
start with simple objects (cube.obj , any simple obj)

for now, load objects just with coordinates if I can, use normal to shade it 
if I can, try to add both 


Surfaces are meshes of polygons: triangles or quads
Maya student version : can use to make own objects (but don’t get too wrapped up), still good to see 

Nehe open gl tutorial  : teaches concepts in term of implementation of openGL 
For implantation 
Textbook  for concepts 

openGL redbook – don’t read first , in between implementation and concept, not tailored to mac 

in pantry @ A*STAR, there is a library. Books might be around the office 
look if I can get access to NUS maybe
