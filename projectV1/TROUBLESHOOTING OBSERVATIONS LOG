/**** TROUBLESHOOTING OBSERVATIONS LOG ****/ 

15 July 2015 : 

			- Model renders correctly, but glEnable(GL_CULLFACE) removes what should be the front face. In other words, object appears black when back face is culled. This is corrected when calling glFrontFace(GL_CW);

			- Rotation enabled, but model always rotates around it's original origin (Should have usered quarternions)

			- When new object is loaded, it is in view, but need to refine centering (currently only works on cube)

			- New bug : objects showing up before anything is loaded 0.o .............. bad
