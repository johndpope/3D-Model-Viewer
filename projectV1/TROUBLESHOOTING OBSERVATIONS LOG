/**** TROUBLESHOOTING OBSERVATIONS LOG ****/ 

15 July 2015 : 

			- (1) Model renders correctly, but glEnable(GL_CULLFACE) removes what should be the front face. In other words, object appears black when back face is culled. This is corrected when calling glFrontFace(GL_CW);

			- (2) Rotation enabled, but model always rotates around it's original origin (Should have usered quarternions)

			- (3) When new object is loaded, it is in view, but need to refine centering (currently only works on cube)

			- (4) New bug : objects showing up before anything is loaded 0.o .............. bad 

			- (5) sometimes crashing on start

16 July 2015 : 
			
			- (3) Repaired.
				x,y,z were not initialized in objLoad::checkMin(Vertex v) 
				
			- (4) Repaired.
				glClear(GL_COLOR_BUFFER_BIT) and glClear(GL_DEPTH_BUFFER_BIT) needed to be called before any .obj loaded. 

			- (5) Crashes on start with message: uncaught exception std::vector out of range 


23 July 2015: 
			- (2) Repaired.

			- (5) Repaired. 
				objPtr needed to be initialized to 0 to prevent premature entry to if(objPtr) in paintGL. 

			New: 

			- (2) Reset when loading new object only works before any transforms applied.
			Repaired: Reset currQ to identity.  
			

			Remaining: 
	
			- (1) See 15 July 2015.
