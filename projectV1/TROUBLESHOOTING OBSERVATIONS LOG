/**** TROUBLESHOOTING OBSERVATIONS LOG ****/ 

15 July 2015 : 

			- Model renders correctly, but glEnable(GL_CULLFACE) removes what should be the front face. In other words, object appears black when back face is culled. This is corrected when calling glFrontFace(GL_CW);

			- Rotation enabled, but model does not rotate about it's center.
